## Introduction
This project is the second part out of three of the implementation of Cluedo Game in simulated environment. In this part we have implemented the architecture of the game and the real movement of the player, a robot Detective, on gazebo simuator. The architecture is divided in three main part: perception, not fully implemented in this part (to have a full implementation on this part, please go to the [third repository of this project](https://github.com/IleD94/exprob_ass_3)), action, fully implemented and planning, implemented using RosPlan service.
The rules of the game are simple. There was a omicide, Mr. Black was killed by someone, somewhere with some weapon. There is a detective, Detective Bot, that goes around (in gazebo envoronment) to find hints to solve the case. Hints can be found in 4 different waypoints, at two different height (1.25 or 0.75, generated randomly for every new game)
1째 waypoint: (2, 0)
2째 waypoint: (0, 2)
3째 waypoint: (-2, 0)
4째 waypoint: (0, -2)


## Robot Model
The robot of the model is contained in the directory urdf. Here we can find detective_bot.gazebo and the detective_bot.xacro files, the file materials.xacro with the materials used for the robot and detective_bot.urdf, generated during the moveit setup. Our robot is a rover with a robotic arm attached to the base of the rover. It is composed by 4 links, as it is shown in the picture below

## Moveit
MoveIt is a package for ros that allows the manipulation of robots. In this project we implemented 3 possible poses for our arm:
1. zero pose (not used in the game)
2. low pose
3. high pose

### Low Pose

## Software architecture

### Planning: PDDL
In order to plan the steps executed by the robot in the quest, we used rosplan. The language of planning used is pddl (Planning Domain Definition Language.
Our domain provides 7 possible actions: initialization, leave_home, go_to_waypoint, move_arm, check_hypothesis, go_home, oracle.
Every action was implemented as a effective action in nodes C++.
The problem created has as goal winningID, this predicates is true only if the oracle action succedeed. To check pddl files please go to che [common directory in erl2 folder](https://github.com/IleD94/exprob_ass_2/tree/main/erl2/common).

### Actions

#### Python nodes
1. OntologySettings.py: This is a Python script that sets the default classes and individuals in the Cluedo ontology using the Armor Client API. The ontology represents the entities in the game such as suspects, weapons, and rooms, and their relationships. We defines three lists of suspects, weapons, and rooms. This script sets up the Cluedo ontology in the Armor server and adds the necessary classes and individuals for the game.
2. go_to_point_action: This is a Python script that handles robot navigation from a starting point to a goal point using a state machine. The script subscribes to the robot's odometry information and publishes Twist messages to control the robot's linear and angular velocity.
3. hint_collection: The node subscribes to a topic "/oracle_hint" and receives messages of type "ErlOracle" which contain information about hints. The node uses the ArmorClient library to interact with the ontology.
When a new hint message is received, the node checks if the hint is malformed and discards it if it is. Otherwise, the hint is added to the "HYPOTHESIS" class of the ontology, along with information about the source (ID), the key (who/what/where), and the value of the hint. The node then checks if the hypothesis is consistent or not by calling the "ontology_query" function, which queries the ontology using the ArmorClient and returns a Boolean value indicating if the hypothesis is consistent or not.The node also provides two ROS services. The first service is "check_hypotesis", which simply returns the Boolean value of the "check" global variable, which is updated by the "ontology_query" function. The second service is "accusation", which calls the "make_ind_of_class_disjoint" function to make all individuals of the classes "PERSON", "WEAPON", and "PLACE" disjoint. It then queries the ontology using the ArmorClient to retrieve the "who", "what", and "where" values of a specific hypothesis (specified by the "HP" variable), and returns these values in a "MyHypo" response.
All the information concerning the game that can be useful for the player are shown in the user_interface
4. Plan_exec: This is a Python script that executes a plan generated by the ROSPlan framework. It calls several ROS services provided by ROSPlan to generate a problem, plan, parse the plan, and dispatch the plan. The script then waits for feedback from the dispatch service to determine if the plan execution was successful or not. If the plan execution was not successful or the goal was not achieved, the script starts the planning process again. The inferred ontology is then saved to a new file using the armor api save_ref_with_inferences function.
5. user_interface: This node just implements the interface with the user. It waits for some strings published to the 'cluedi_ui' topic to dislay them on the screen.
