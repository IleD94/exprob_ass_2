# exprob_ass_2
## Introduction
This project is the second part out of three of the implementation of Cluedo Game in simulated environment. In this part we have implemented the architecture of the game and the real movement of the player, a robot Detective, on gazebo simuator. The architecture is divided in three main part: perception, not fully implemented in this part (to have a full implementation on this part, please go to the [third repository of this project](https://github.com/IleD94/exprob_ass_3))  Ontology, Armor service, Default Settings, Cluedo FSM, Oracle e User Interface. The rules of the games are simple. There was a omicide, Mr. Black was killed by someone, somewhere with some weapone. There is a detective, Detective Bot, that goes around (not implemented yet in this part) to find hints to solve the case!
